# Excercism JavaScript Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for various tracks on Exercism.io in the JavaScript programming language.

## Project Structure
* The root directory contains this README file and a list of all the tracks I've worked on.
* Each track is organized into a separate directory, which contains a README with a brief description of the track and a list of the exercises that I've completed.
* Each exercise has its own directory, which contains a README with a description of the problem and a list of the files that I've created to solve the problem.
